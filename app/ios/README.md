# Build and Release

CI will take care of building the app and releasing it to the app store. We use Bitrise.io for that.

## Signing

If the certificates are not working follow this guide to replace them: https://devcenter.bitrise.io/code-signing/ios-code-signing/code-signing-index/

## Releasing

Push `master` to `release_ios` to start the release process.
